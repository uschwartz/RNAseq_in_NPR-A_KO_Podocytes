# Identification of natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) expression signatures in podocytes in vivo reveals baseline control of protective pathways including Protein S and Semaphorin 3G

Natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) is the principal receptor for the natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP. Targeted deletion of NPR-A in mouse glomerular podocytes in vivo leads to significant amplification of renal injury in DOCA-salt experimental model. It was hypothesized that natriuretic peptides through NPR-A in podocytes maintain and support the glomerular barrier integrity through specific expression patterns.
